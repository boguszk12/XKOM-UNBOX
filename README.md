# XKOM-UNBOX
Program for abusing X-Kom's unboxing promotion, made for educational purposes

For starters, main.py is stable and mainThreaded.py is too. Difference is that threaded gets added threading.

# Basically you have 2 options:
1. Account creator
2. Unbox boxes for all the created accounts

For now there is only one api key support, thus meaning only 50 accounts created per run.

The threading version NEEDS to be ran with proxies. X-Kom heavily limits the requests per minute.
